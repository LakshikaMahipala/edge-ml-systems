# Mini-project 12 — Derived architectures + benchmark 

## 1) Models compared
1. Baseline small CNN
2. DARTS-derived discrete model (from genotype.json)
3. One-shot derived discrete model (from best_subnet.json)
4. (optional) Latency-aware DARTS derived model

## 2) Benchmark method
- warmup iterations
- measure iterations
- report p50 and p99

## 3) Results (to be filled after running)
See report/tables/template_results.csv

## 4) Expected learning outcomes
- you understand the discretization gap (mixed vs discrete)
- you can ship a complete NAS → benchmark pipeline
- you have a clean place in GitHub where others can reproduce
