FPGA Track 

Goal
- Build a real ML-hardware portfolio starting from reliable FPGA fundamentals:
  UART I/O -> fixed-point math -> INT8 kernels -> streaming datapaths.

Current projects
1) hello_uart_echo
   - UART RX + UART TX + echo top
   - Self-checking testbench
   - Simulation-first workflow (Vivado xsim or iverilog)

How to run simulations (later)
- See each project README.
- Vivado setup notes: docs/fpga_setup_vivado.md
