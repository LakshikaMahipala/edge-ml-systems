# Mini-project 9 Scope 

This mini-project consolidates four efficient-math techniques:
1) Strassen (matrix multiply)
2) Winograd (3x3 convolution, F(2x2,3x3) demo)
3) FFT convolution (1D crossover + 2D spot-check)
4) Low-rank SVD compression (Linear layer)

We provide:
- reference implementations
- benchmark harness scripts (run later)
- unified reporting schema
- FPGA implications and what to measure when hardware is available
