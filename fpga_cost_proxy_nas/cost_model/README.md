FPGA Cost Proxy Model 

Outputs (all proxies)
- cycles_proxy: log(ops/P)
- lut_proxy: log(heuristic LUT pressure)
- bram_proxy: log(heuristic buffer/weight pressure)
- bw_proxy: log(rough data movement proxy)

Purpose
- rank architectures under FPGA-like constraints
- not a substitute for synthesis or board measurement
