NAS Foundations 

Day 1:
- define search space and architecture encoding
- build model from encoding
- create proxy metrics (params, MACs)
- sample candidate architectures

Next:
- RL NAS toy controller
- reduced-training proxies + aging evaluation
- zero-cost proxies
- FPGA-aware cost proxy integration
