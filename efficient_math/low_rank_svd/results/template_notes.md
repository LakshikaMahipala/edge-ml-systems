# Low-rank SVD notes (fill after runs)

Machine:
Torch:
Device (cpu/gpu):

Observations:
- Best rank (accuracy vs speed):
- Crossover where low-rank becomes faster:
- Error tolerance acceptable?

Hardware angle:
- How would rank r map to FPGA unroll factors?
- What is the cost of storing intermediate vector of size r?
