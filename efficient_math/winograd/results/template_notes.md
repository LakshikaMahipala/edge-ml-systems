# Winograd benchmark notes (fill after runs)

Machine:
Python/NumPy:
Notes on BLAS (if relevant):

Observations:
- Winograd vs naive speed:
- Numerical error:
- Any instability signs (FP16/INT8 not tested yet):

FPGA angle:
- Which parts are add-heavy?
- Where would fixed-point scaling be needed?
- What buffering would be needed for streaming tiles?
