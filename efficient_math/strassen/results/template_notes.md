# Strassen benchmark notes (fill after runs)

Machine:
BLAS backend:
Python:
NumPy:

Key observations:
- Crossover point (if any):
- Best leaf_size:
- Did Strassen beat numpy.dot? If yes, at what N? If no, why?

Interpretation (systems):
- cache/memory effects:
- recursion overhead:
- BLAS optimization effect:
