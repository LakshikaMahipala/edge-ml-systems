# Mini-project 11 storyboard (NAS + FPGA-aware ranking)

Goal:
Show that different proxies produce different rankings and why FPGA-aware ranking matters.

Sections:
1) Search space recap 
2) RL controller recap 
3) Reduced-training proxy 
4) Zero-cost proxies 
5) FPGA cost proxy integration 
6) Rank comparison + Spearman correlations
7) Conclusions: when proxies agree, when they diverge
