# Correlation via Spearman rank

NAS uses ranking.
We care less about absolute score and more about ordering.

Spearman rank correlation:
- compares ranked lists
- robust to monotonic transformations

We will correlate:
- zero-cost proxy rank
vs
- reduced-training proxy rank (Day 3)

Higher Spearman = better ranking agreement.
