# Pareto frontier

The Pareto frontier is the set of models that are not dominated.

Interpretation:
- each frontier point is a valid “best” choice depending on constraints
- the frontier shows tradeoffs (e.g., faster models cost accuracy)

In real engineering:
- if you have a latency budget, you pick the highest-accuracy point that meets it
- if you have an energy budget, pick the best under that constraint
