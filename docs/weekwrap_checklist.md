# Wrap checklist

Artifacts that should exist:
- Quantization docs + QAT mini-project
- Pruning docs + unstructured/structured scripts
- BNN docs + BNN training scripts
- LUTNet notes module
- FPGA BNN dot kernel RTL + testbench + Python golden
- Mini-project 10 report with evidence rules + run-later plan

If local execution becomes available later:
- run QAT training and record metrics JSON
- run pruning sweeps and record metrics
- run BNN training and record metrics
- run FPGA simulation testbench and record PASS/FAIL
- update Mini-project 10 table with real numbers
