GNN latency predictor design spec

This module defines:
- graph representation of neural networks (nodes/edges/globals)
- node + edge feature spec (research-grade)
- targets/labels and few-shot training protocol
- validation metrics (ranking + error)
- stubs for feature extraction and model training

Next:
implements a small predictor (baseline MLP or simple GNN).
